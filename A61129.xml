            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AMongſt the great variety of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Practical Diſcourſes this preſent Age has produced, I have often wondered, that no more has been written concerning the Duty here treated of. Than which, though no ſort of Vertue is more uſefull for all Eſtates and Conditions of Life, and eſpecially for teaching how to bear Afflictions with a truly Chriſtian Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Reſignation to the Divine Will, yet I know none that has ever ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to a particular Conſideration of it. The admirable Author of <hi>the Whole Duty of Man,</hi> the Learned Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> Dr. <hi>Scott,</hi> and ſome others, have recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended it, as a neceſſary and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Branch of Chriſtianity. But their more general Deſigns allowed them not to enlarge upon it, to the prejudice of thoſe other Duties, they were to inſiſt
<pb n="ij" facs="tcp:54666:3"/>upon alſo at the ſame time. And none elſe having undertaken it, (unleſs perhaps within the compaſs of a Sermon) I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded my ſelf, that I could not do God and Religion better ſervice, than by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering what Meditations ſeemed to me moſt proper for inviting to it, nor could propoſe any Expedient, that might tend more to Men's Quiet and eaſie Paſſage through this troubleſome World.</p>

Nor can any thing be a greater refreſhment to an afflicted Soul, than to remember, that not Fortune, nor Chance, nor Fate, nor the Malice, the Ambition, the Revenge, the Avarice, the Treachery of wicked Men, nor even the Power and Spight and Subtility of the Devil, governs the World, but all our affairs are ordered by an infinitely Wiſe and Good God, who knows our Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion much better than our ſelves do, and
<pb n="iij" facs="tcp:54666:3"/>loves us much better than we love our ſelves, and will be ſure to make a far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter choice for us, than we could for our ſelves.</p>
            <p>For my own part, I muſt confeſs to my Maker's Glory, that it having been my portion of late years to have met with troubles of different kinds, I have always found a ſerious Reflexion upon his good Providence the beſt ſupport under them; and the more ſenſibly ſo, by how much the more firmly I have fixed my thoughts upon him, and endeavoured to comfort and encourage my ſelf in him.</p>
            <p>This put me upon drawing up the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diſcourſe, and now upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting it to the Chriſtian Reader, in hope that it may not prove wholly uſeleſs to others in the like, or worſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; or at leaſt, that its Defects may tempt ſome abler Author to reſume the Argument, and ſupply what is wanting here. And if it ſhall have either of theſe effects, I ſhall not reckon my time or pains to have been miſ-employed.</p>
            <p>And becauſe a conſtant and conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Dependance upon God is an excellent Preparative for <hi>Suffering for Righteouſneſs,</hi> whenſoever he in his wiſe Providence ſees fit to call us to it, I have ventured to ſubjoyn a Diſcourſe alſo upon that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:54666:4"/>that as the former I hope may be of uſe for enabling, ſo this other may be a means of engaging us, to <hi>take up our Croſs,</hi> and follow our Bleſſed Lord through all the Impediments we may at any time have occaſion to encounter with in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, fighting manfully under his ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, deſpiſing all terreſtrial Advantages, in compariſon of the ineſtimable, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable Glories of the other State, and ſtudying to expreſs our hearty Senſe of what our Redeemer has ſo graciouſly done and ſuffered for us, by <hi>conforming our ſelves to his Image,</hi> who was <hi>made perfect through ſufferings,</hi> treading in his ſteps, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning our ſelves entirely to our heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father's Will, patiently, undauntedly, and meekly to bear whatſoever is brought upon us for his ſake.</p>
            <p>I confeſs I have all along, in what I have written, proceeded upon Chriſtian Principles, taking it for a ſufficient Proof of a ſuper-intending Providence to order our affairs for us, that the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures bear ſuch undeniable teſtimony to it. Greater Authority cannot be had for any Truth, than the expreſs Word of God declaring it. And this therefore I have reſted upon, as the beſt foundation for whatſoever Doctrines I have laid down, or Arguments I have urged in behalf of them.</p>
            <pb n="v" facs="tcp:54666:4"/>
            <p>Yet conſidering the ſhamefull degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of our Times, wherein too many, that bear our Saviour's Name, ſtick not however to decry all Divine Revelation, and ſet up for bare Reaſon and the Light of Nature, as their only Guide. I was once<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 3. Sect. 1.</note> about to have addreſſed my ſelf to theſe in their own way, to ſhew, that beſides the abundant Evidence we have from Scripture, their ſo much admired Reaſon pleads loudly for, nay undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evinces the Certainty of an over-ruling Providence. But finding this underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king like to ſwell to a much greater length than I had expected, and fearing leſt it might cauſe too great a breach in the thread of my Diſcourſe, and might be tedious and unſeaſonable to the better ſort of Chriſtians, who are already ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſatisfied of this great Truth, and need not to have it thus inculcated, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered my deſign, and ſent the Sheets to the Preſs, as they now appear, intending only to give ſome ſhort intimation of the Arguments I had ſuppreſſed, in this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</p>
            <p>But I have ſince been perſwaded to perfect what I had thus begun, and to publiſh it in this place; where, coming by it ſelf, it will make no interruption in the body of the Diſcourſe; and beſides,
<pb n="vj" facs="tcp:54666:5"/>will leave the Reader the more perfectly at liberty, either to peruſe, or paſs it by, as he ſhall think moſt proper.</p>
            <p>Now the Arguments which I deſigned to have urged in this Caſe, and which I here propoſe to the ſerious Conſideration, of all that are not ſufficiently and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly convinced of the certainty of a ſuper-intending Providence, and the juſt ground they therefore have to reſt upon it, are ſuch as ariſe from theſe five following Heads.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. The Nature of Almighty God, and the Perfection of his Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes.</item>
               <item>II. The Creation of the World.</item>
               <item>III. The Continuance of things in the ſtate we ſee them in.</item>
               <item>IV. The excellent Order and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the ſeveral Parts of the World.</item>
               <item>V. And Laſtly, The many extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Effects that have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved at any time, beyond, nay contrary to the wonted Power and Laws of Nature.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">I. The firſt (which alone, if rightly attended to, were an abundant proof of the matter in queſtion) is taken from the
<pb n="vij" facs="tcp:54666:5"/>Nature of Almighty God, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his Divine Attributes; whence he not only is able to manage and order all things, but is likewiſe inclined to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the welfare of all. For none who believes a God, but muſt believe him to be abſolutely Perfect; and amongſt other his Divine Excellencies, muſt believe him to be infinitely Wiſe, Powerfull, and Good. And whoſoever owns this, muſt farther own,<note n="*" place="margin">Quid igitur in Deo poteſt eſſe beatitudo, ſi ſemper quietus, &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mobilis torpet? Si pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantibus ſurdus, ſi co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentibus caecus? Quid tam dignum, tam pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prium Deo, quam Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntia? <hi>Lactant. de irâ Dei, c.</hi> 4. Si eſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, utique Providens eſt ut Deus, <hi>ibid. c.</hi> 9.</note> that theſe Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes neceſſarily imply an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of them, for the benefit of any that ſtand in need of it. For infinite Wiſdom will be ſure to find out the ſtreights and troubles of the diſtreſſed; infinite Power will eaſily fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh out means for their relief; and infinite Goodneſs will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily excite to the uſe of all theſe means. So that where all theſe Perfections con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, (as they moſt manifeſtly do in Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God,) it muſt argue great weakneſs in any to doubt whether they will exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves whenſoever there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears a proper occaſion for it. And<note n="†" place="margin">Exiſtimo tamen eam [n. Providentiam] ita con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentaneam eſſe, naturae Dei, ejuſque divinis Proprieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus,—ut qui eam Deo competere dubitare an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det, vix inter ſanos, &amp; mentis ſuae compotes; cenſeri debeat. <hi>Inſtit. Theol. l.</hi> 4. <hi>ſect.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</note> 
               <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> therefore had good reaſon to cenſure ſuch, <hi>as hardly in their ſenſes,</hi> who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="viij" facs="tcp:54666:6"/>not but acknowledge a God thus inſinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perfect, and yet are unwilling to own a Providence; and<note n="*" place="margin">Cum igitur Providentiam ſuſtulit, etiam Deum negavit eſſe. <hi>De irâ Dei, c.</hi> 9.</note> 
               <hi>Lactantius,</hi> to charge it home upon <hi>Epicurus,</hi> that by denying a Providence, he in effect denied the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God too, who could not rationally be ſuppoſed to exiſt without it. A Deity without a Providence, is an egregious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. And it were incomparably eaſier to imagine that the Sun ſhould be without light, or Fire without heat, than that an infinitely gracious and good God ſhould be without doing good. In a word, As certainly as God is, he delights in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Beneficence; and as certainly as he doth this, there is and muſt be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence concerning it ſelf for the welfare of thoſe that depend upon him.</p>
            <p n="2">II. However, for the farther proof hereof, I proceed to argue from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World. For let a Man conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the World cannot poſſibly have been from Eternity; as, beſides the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation <hi>Moſes</hi> gives of its Original, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally enough collected from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts we have of the beginnings of Arts and Learning; from the want of any, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hiſtory or Tradition, ancienter than the ſuppoſed time of the Creation; from the nature of Time and Motion, each of
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:54666:6"/>which implying in it a Succeſſion, muſt unavoidably imply alſo that it had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; from the propagation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and other living Creatures; all which muſt neceſſarily have had ſome firſt Head or Parent, from whom they proceeded, though at never ſo great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and laſtly, from the<note n="*" place="margin">

And as for the greateſt part of the New Teſtament, and indeed all that I have need to recurr to in the caſe before us, there not only was never any doubt amongſt the regular and orthodox Chriſtians concerning its being genuine, but it was never queſtioned by <hi>Celſus,</hi> or <hi>Julian,</hi> or any of its moſt avowed Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, who we are ſure would never have ſpared the Chriſtians, if they could have found any pretence for an objection in this reſpect. And beſides, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of theſe holy Writings were Men of untainted reputation, upon whom no inſtance of impoſture could be fixed, they were moreover ſo different for qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſome of them Kings and great Men, ſome of them mean and illiterate, no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Shepherds, or Fiſhers, or Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, ſome of a middle condition between both, ſo many for number, and who wrote in ſuch diſtant times, that they could never poſſibly be thought to have all combined together, to deceive the World, nor like to have eſcaped a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, if they could have attempted it.</p>
            <p>The Authours and Publiſhers of the New Teſtament were ſuch who had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to expect in this World, but tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and afflictions, and death, the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="xxiij" facs="tcp:54666:13"/>that our Saviour had foretold would be allotted to his Diſciples; and in the World to come they could have no good to hope for, if they had only conſpired to delude Mankind, in tranſmitting to all generations what they knew to be falſe. And hence they could have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Deſign to ſerve in what they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, but that of propagating the Truth.</p>
            <p>And ſince the writing and divulging of the Scriptures, they have been tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into abundantly more Languages, have had incomparably more Copies and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and been the ſubject of vaſtly more Commentaries, Annotations, Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſes, and given occaſion for multitudes more of Diſquiſitions and Diſcourſes, and upon all theſe accounts were apparently far leſs liable to be corrupted, than any other Authours whatſoever. They have had the teſtimony of a whole cloud of Chriſtian Martyrs, who ſtuck not readily to reſign their lives, in purſuance of the Truth contained therein. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the oppoſition that has been made againſt them, they have prevailed to that degree, as plainly to ſhew a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Bleſſing going along with them, to give them ſucceſs in ſpight of all the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:54666:14"/>and his utmoſt contrivances for their ſuppreſſion. So that after all this he muſt be monſtrouſly unreaſonable, that will not yet be induced to place them in the rank of the moſt credible Hiſtorians, or indeed that ſees not of what unſpeakably greater Authority they are, than all other the moſt celebrated Hiſtories. The leaſt that can poſſibly be inferred from theſe Premiſes is, that either Men muſt utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renounce all Hiſtory, and all pretence to the knowledge of what is paſt before their own days, or they muſt be brought to confeſs the Scriptures a juſt foundation for their belief of the Matters related in them. And this being once granted, there can be no difficulty in the proof of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes both of Propheſies and of Miracles, to evince the certainty of an over-ruling Providence.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Prophecies. And here, if I ſhould begin with that of <hi>Noah,</hi> concerning the Deluge of Waters that was to be <hi>brought upon the World of the ungodly,</hi> it would eaſily be ſhewn that he was certainly a true Prophet, though he had <hi>Caſſandra</hi>'s fate, not to be attended to by an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous generation, till their own ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience too late convinced them of the reality of his Predictions. He not only
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:54666:14"/>informed them of their approaching de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as may juſtly be collected from his Hiſtory in the ſixth and ſeventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s affirmation,<note place="margin">1 Ep. 3.20.</note> that <hi>God waited in the days of Noah, while the Ark was preparing,</hi> which it is not conceivable he would do without giving notice of it to the people, whoſe repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance he waited for; <hi>Noah</hi> I ſay, not only informed the old World of their approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtruction, but gave them moreover a daily evidence of his own belief and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of what he warned them to provide againſt, by building a capacious Ark, wherein to preſerve himſelf, and his houſhold, and ſome of all living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, when the reſt ſhould be waſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the Flood, that was ſhortly to come upon them. Nor was he diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed;<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 6.</note> for at the end of <hi>an hundred and twenty years,</hi> the time prefixed for the execution of this intended vengeance, the waters came upon them, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them all, except thoſe <hi>Jew Souls</hi> who were with him in the Ark. Than which, one would not deſire a clearer inſtance of a divine Preſcience, and an uncontroulable Power, that can when it pleaſes, <hi>open the windows of heaven, and break up the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the great deep,</hi> or make whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever like alterations in the courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="xxvj" facs="tcp:54666:15"/>that is of an over-ruling Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>If I ſhould mention in the next place, the notice that was given to the Patriarch <hi>Abraham,</hi> when as yet he had no child, and had little hopes of any, that he ſhould however<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 12.2.</note> 
               <hi>be bleſſed, and his Name made great,</hi> which is<note n="†" place="margin">C. 13, 14, 15, 16. &amp;c. 15.5.</note> afterward explained to import, (not to touch here upon what related to our bleſſed Saviour) that his ſeed ſhould be exceeding numerous, <hi>as the duſt of the earth, and the ſtars of heaven,</hi> which cannot be reckoned up, and that all the land he could ſee, whether <hi>north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> or <hi>ſouthward,</hi> or <hi>eaſtward,</hi> or <hi>weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> ſhould be given them to inherit; and<note n="‖" place="margin">C. 17. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</note> again, that he ſhould be <hi>the Father of many Nations, and Kings ſhould come out of him; and to him, and his ſeed after him, ſhould be given all the land</hi> wherein he ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed, the land of <hi>Canaan, for an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting poſſeſſion;</hi> but withall, that they ſhould not enter upon the inheritance of this promiſed land,<note n="*" place="margin">C. 15.13.</note> till <hi>the fourth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, when the iniquity of the Amorites would be full,</hi> and would by this means occaſion their utter extirpation; this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction alſo muſt be granted to have been accordingly fulfilled, when beſides the <hi>Edomites</hi> and <hi>Moabites</hi> deſcended from <hi>Iſmael,</hi> the Poſterity of <hi>Iſaac</hi> was encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="xxvij" facs="tcp:54666:15"/>into a great People, and being above 400 years after this Promiſe, conducted by <hi>Joſhua</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſettled there, became in time two potent and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kingdoms, and were bleſſed and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly favoured by God above all the nations of the Earth, and might have continued ſo had they not by their multiplied tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions provoked God to drive them out of the good land that he had given them, and withdraw his Preſence from them.</p>
            <p>Whereto if I ſhould farther add that Meſſage of the Prophet <hi>Jado,</hi> as<note n="*" place="margin">Antiq l. 8. c. 3.</note>

Thus to ſtand out againſt the cleareſt light is a ſign only of a perverſe mind, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be ſatisfied, not of any real want of ſatisfaction. And they muſt be beſides themſelves, that could behold theſe and other the like amazing operations, and not be affected with a ſenſe of that moſt mighty hand by which they were wrought.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially if they ſhould obſerve with-all, that theſe were not done caſually or
<pb n="lxv" facs="tcp:54666:34"/>at random, but when there was ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular occaſion for them, and they might tend in a peculiar manner to God's glory.

            <p>Nor is it of any great importance which is here objected, <q>That the ſilence of Heathen Authors concerning theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles is a great obſtruction to their credibility, and makes it very queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, whether ever they were wrought or not. For how could it be, that ſo many and ſo prodigious effects ſhould have been brought to paſs, and no more notice taken of them? Might it
<pb n="lxvij" facs="tcp:54666:35"/>not rather have been expected, that the World aſtoniſhed at them, ſhould have taken care conſtantly to tranſmit their memory from generation to generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? at leaſt that as much regard ſhould have been had to them, as has been had to preſerve the remembrance of other leſs ſurprizing occurrences?

Who doubts of theſe or other the like relations, ſince they are mentioned by Authors of good credit, and againſt whom there is no juſt exception? Yet we have much greater Authority for the Miracles I have been inſiſting upon. For if thoſe be recorded by ſome of the Hiſtorians, who wrote of the times wherein they were done, we have the teſtimony of the holy Scriptures, of the Fathers, and of Hiſtorians for theſe. If their Authors were Men of credit and veracity, ours much more. If they had no temptation to byaſs them in what they related, much leſs had ours, when they knew their teſtifying theſe things, and adhering to the Doctrines confirmed by them, was the ready way to ſet all the World againſt themſelves. And it is therefore an egregious inſtance of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, to be willing to believe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and yet not believe the latter, whoſe authority, if duly attended to, will be found to be incomparably the greater.</p>

            <p>And now if we put theſe things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that divers of the Miracles recorded in the Old Teſtament are mentioned alſo in ſome ſort by Heathen Writers, that the <hi>Jews</hi> were a people of no great reputation amongſt the reſt of the World, and about whoſe affairs other Nations did not much concern themſelves, that we have a very imperfect account of any thing done in any part of the World in the times when theſe Miracles were wrought, except what remains in the Old Teſtament and the Jewiſh Hiſtorian <hi>Joſephus;</hi> and laſtly, that had more been written concerning them, there has ſince been time enough to have had it quite loſt, unleſs it met with a better ſate than the Works of ſeveral later Authors.

            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer in theſe following particulars.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. It was by no means to be expected that the Enemies to Chriſtianity ſhould be ready to bear ſuch ample, ſuch unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Teſtimony to it, as a due acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of theſe Miracles muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily have been. When almoſt all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſeemed to have unanimouſly conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to obſtruct the propagation of our Religion, and as much as in them lay to
<pb n="lxxvij" facs="tcp:54666:40"/>explode it out of the World, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> exerting their utmoſt force to this purpoſe, who could think that their Writers would make it their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to plead for it, and confirm and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh it, by acquainting all generations what amazing teſtimony was born to it, above any other Doctrine that ever was in the World; what mighty ſigns and wonders were wrought for its vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? This were to contradict themſelves, to build what at the ſame time they were earneſtly endeavouring to pull down, and in effect to defeat all the moſt violent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of their enraged Governours for its extirpation. And nothing but the want of a better argument could tempt Men to urge their ſilence in this caſe as a juſt confutation of theſe Miracles, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the prejudice Mankind were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally under, againſt the Religion theſe were wrought in favour of, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger that might have enſued upon their publication of them.</item>
               <item>2. It was enough that theſe things were conſtantly atteſted by the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and in the publickeſt manner that might be, and appealed to as a very ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal evidence of the truth of our Religion, and of the errour and wickedneſs of all
<pb n="lxxviij" facs="tcp:54666:41"/>that ſet themſelves to oppoſe it, and yet could not be denied by <hi>Celſus,</hi> or <hi>Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> or <hi>Porphyry,</hi> or <hi>Lucian,</hi> or any of their moſt avowed Adverſaries, though theſe we may be ſure would by no means have omitted ſo fair an opportunity of expoſing the Chriſtian Apologiſts and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Writers, if they had known how to do it. Had not what was urged of this kind been too evident to be contradicted, they muſt have looked to have heard of it with both Ears. They had to deal with Men, who would willingly have been at the pains of detecting their forgery, if they had ſuſpected them to have been guilty of any, and would not have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born to divulge it with all the freedom that might be, and all the moſt heinous aggravations it had been capable of. And their Silence in this reſpect is therefore a much more convincing proof of the truth and reality of the Chriſtians Pretenſions, than it was againſt them in the other. The ſame motives that with-held any from publiſhing thoſe Miracles they knew to be true, would no leſs have prevailed with them on the other hand to make the World ring of it, if they had been falſe. And that notwithſtanding all their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices againſt Chriſtianity, and averſion to it, they ſhould patiently hear its Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions
<pb n="lxxix" facs="tcp:54666:41"/>appealing upon all occaſions to the teſtimony of Miracles, as well as to the other Arguments that tended to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and propagate their Religion, and not have the confidence to contradict it, is a plain intimation of their aſſurance of the truth of it, and as great an evidence in its behalf as could be expected from perſons in their circumſtances. And this makes it very unreaſonable to call this ſort of Teſtimony into queſtion, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſilence of its enemies, which to any conſidering perſon muſt needs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to make much more ſtrongly for, than it doth againſt it.</item>

And laſtly, They that pretend to disbelieve theſe Miracles, argue at a very ſtrange rate, whilſt they diſown them, and yet daily ſee the prevalence of that moſt holy Religion, which they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to propagate; and for which to have prevailed as it did, againſt the luſts and temporal intereſts of Mankind, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aſſiſtance of any Miracles, had been perhaps no leſs a Miracle than any of thoſe I am treating of.</item>

            <p>Had Chriſtianity been adapted to the corrupt inclinations of Men, or though
<pb n="lxxxij" facs="tcp:54666:43"/>unagreeable to theſe, had it been promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as <hi>Mahometaniſm</hi> was, by the power of the Sword, no wonder if it had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Proſelytes without any farther aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. But when the caſe was juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this; when our Saviour's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine aimed directly at curbing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining the vices of its Profeſſors, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably obliging them to an exact uprightneſs of converſation, to bring down the high looks of the proud, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the impetuous exceſſes of the paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, to ſubdue the ungovernable appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites of the luſtfull and laſcivious, to cure the continual cravings of the covetous, to ſtop the fury of the malicious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengefull, and in all reſpects to make Men holy and heavenly-minded here, and prepare them for a better ſtate here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; and when moreover all the force and power of the World was againſt it, endeavouring its utter ſubverſion, not its propagation; when the bleſſed Author of this Doctrine had been deſpiſed, calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niated, derided, and at laſt put to death upon the Croſs under the notion of a Malefactor, and its Profeſſors were to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the greateſt difficulties, to ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with Men and Devils, with their own ſinfull inclinations, and with all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

Inſomuch that had we no other proof of them, but only that our Religion is thus wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſpread over the face of the Earth, (as we have abundance) this one obſervation would plead hard for the belief of ſome Miracles at firſt, as its Credentials, though we at this diſtance knew not of what ſort they were. But when we not only ſee this ſurprizing ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but have a full and particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of theſe Miracles too, from thoſe that were beſt acquainted with them, and beſt qualified to tranſmit them to
<pb n="lxxxiv" facs="tcp:54666:44"/>poſterity, it is monſtrouſly unreaſonable ſtill to doubt of them, only becauſe of the ſilence of ſome others, whoſe intereſt it was to ſtifle them all they could.</p>
            <p>And thus I perſwade my ſelf I have ſufficiently eſtabliſhed the certainty of an over-ruling Providence, which cannot be queſtioned without queſtioning at the ſame time, all thoſe numerous Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, whoſe accompliſhments long after (and yet juſt as had been foretold) have ſhewn them to have proceeded from the Spirit of God, and all thoſe ſeveral ſorts of Miracles which we are ſufficiently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured were wrought, and yet could not be wrought but by the finger of God; and which moreover follows neceſſarily from the nature of the divine Attributes, and is farther manifeſted from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, and from its Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in Being, and eſpecially in that admirable Order and Harmony, which ſo loudly proclaims its Maker's Glory. Theſe Conſiderations Reaſon, unaſſiſted by ſupernatural Revelation, ſuggeſts in behalf of a ſuper-intending Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and conſequently in order to a ſteady Dependance upon it in all our Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies. And ſince they were like to
<pb n="lxxxv" facs="tcp:54666:44"/>grow to this length, I hope the Reader will think it excuſable that I did not inſert them in the body of the following Diſcourſe, and yet conſidering that good uſe may be made of them, that he will not blame me for having been prevailed with to add them here.</p>

                     <p>SO numerous, and ſo preſſing are the Troubles that continually attend Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, ſo many the Loſſes and Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes to which the Richeſt, ſo many the Croſſes and Vexations to which the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, ſo many the unhappy Diſappointments to which the Wiſeſt are liable; and yet ſo much more pungent are the Sorrows and the Wants whereto the generality of Men, but eſpecially the meaner ſort, are expos'd; as may well put each one upon a ſerious Enquiry after the beſt Method of arming himſelf againſt them. This all are ſufficiently ſenſible of, howſoever they are too frequently miſtaken in the Means they chooſe to make uſe of in order to their welfare.</p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:54666:47"/>
                     <p>The common Practice is, to try what may be done by the aſſiſtance of Power, Wealth, Friends, or other the like helps, in hope that theſe may be able to render the Owners Lives comfortable and eaſie. And yet it is obſervable, that when Men have diligently laboured after theſe Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages all their days, they are but few who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to any conſiderable ſhare of them; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that when obtained, and in the greateſt plenty, they are ſtill but a very feeble Guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt divers of thoſe Evils to which we are all obnoxious. They can neither preſerve from bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Pains and Diſeaſes, nor compoſe a diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mind, nor recover a loſt Member, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long a decaying Life, nor any other way make thoſe happy who have nothing better to depend upon. If wiſely managed they may tend much to the Owner's benefit, both here and hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and are therefore to be thankfully received, and carefully improved to the Glory of God, the Giver of them.</p>
                     <p>But yet they fall ſo far ſhort of what Men are apt to promiſe themſelves from them, that ſome who ſeem to have ſeriouſly conſidered their Inſufficiency, have profeſſed themſelves<note n="*" place="margin">

                        <p>To uſe all other means for accompliſhing our Ends, but not to forbear offending God, upon whoſe Bleſſing all our hopes of ſucceſs depend, is juſt as if one ſick of a violent Fever ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve conſtantly to follow his Doctor's Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in duly taking all his Doſes, how unagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſoever, in bleeding, or being ſcarified, or otherwiſe tortured; or in abſtaining from Fleſh, or ſtrong Drinks, for fear of heightening his Diſtemper; but ſhould have no regard at all to preſerve himſelf from taking Cold, though this be at leaſt as dangerous as an error, or neglect in any of the other caſes; or as if a Man ſhould call up his Family, and beſtirr himſelf to barricadoe up his Windows, and guard and ſecure all the weaker places of his Houſe, from the Attempts of Thieves, by whom he apprehends himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to be beſet; but ſhould in the mean time leave the Doors neither ſhut nor guarded.

When your fear cometh as deſolation, and your deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction cometh as a whirlwind; when diſtreſs and anguiſh cometh upon you, then ſhall they call upon me, but I will not anſwer; they ſhall ſeek me early but they ſhall not find me: for that they hated knowledge, and did not chuſe the fear of the Lord. They would none of my counſel, they deſpiſed all my reproof. Therefore ſhall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</hi> And no marvel if what is thus threatened be accordingly fulfill'd. However this is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to them that are duely qualify'd for the Divine Favour, nor any proof that theſe ſhall not have whatever Promiſes they meet with for their encouragement, ſome way or other made good to them; but it teaches us on the other hand, to what ſource the very beſt are to impute their Sufferings, and that (though God may
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54666:58"/>have other wiſe Ends to be ſerved, and good uſes to be made of them, yet) their Sins are the only meritorious cauſe of them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. To caution Perſons againſt the likelieſt means of fruſtrating their Hopes: For if God's promiſes of Protection are made particularly and only to the Righteous, it muſt needs be, that ſo far as any one falls ſhort of this Character, ſo much the leſs Intereſt he will have in thoſe Promiſes. His Iniquities, if they do not utterly prevent the Bleſſings he deſires, (as he has too great reaſon to fear they may) will yet be ſure to deprive him of that undaunted truſt in God's Goodneſs, which he would otherwiſe have found to be an admirable Conſolation in all Conditions. So that hereby he becomes at beſt but like a deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Man in the Ocean labouring for his life, or that is left unfortunately in a deſart Iſland, where he has a poſſibility to eſcape, but has no aſſurance of it to depend upon. A Veſſel may come that way, and eaſe him of his fears and dangers, when about to be ſwallowed up of the mercileſs Waves, or devoured by ſome ravenous Beaſt of prey, and may bring him ſafe to his own Home; but this is more than he can any way promiſe himſelf. And if no one in his Wits would knowingly quit his Ship to run either of theſe hazards, much leſs ſhould any dare to allow themſelves in what may expoſe them to the juſt Wrath of Almighty God; and hence may exclude them from that Intereſt in his Favour, which is the beſt Support under all Calamities, and the want whereof, if it do not prevail with him to deny them what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever good Things they ask of him, yet leaves them at very great uncertainty, whether they ſhall partake of them or not; and again, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54666:59"/>it ſhall be for their benefit if they be vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed them, or only in order to their greater Condemnation.</p>

There is no caſe ſo forlorn but he regardes it, and has by him a Remedy in ſtore for it, which if duely apply'd, will effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally work a cure. If he but command Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for his Servants, all the Power of Men

                        <p>And, indeed, conſidering the Tranſitorineſs of our preſent State, and the uncertainty of every thing we can poſſeſs or hope for in it, and that it is not in our power to make our Condition as we would have it, or to preſerve it if it were ſuch, but that for ought we know to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, ſome unlucky chance may the very next moment either take away all our Enjoyments from us, or us from them; and therefore we can have no ſecurity of any thing but from the good Providence of God, no proſpect of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, whether here or hereafter, but only from his boundleſs Compaſſion; conſidering theſe things, I ſay, it is eaſie to inferr how nearly our Intereſt depends upon his gracious Inclinations towards us, his perpetual Care being our beſt,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54666:60"/>our only Defence againſt thoſe numerous Evils, to which, were it not for this, each one would lie continually expos'd; and conſequently what egregious folly it is not to rely intirely upon him for thoſe Benefits that are to be expected only from him. I confeſs, were Mankind capable of making any tolerable proviſion for themſelves, without the Divine Aſſiſtance, they would have ſo much the leſs Encouragement to caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon God, and would therefore act with leſs inconſiſtence in the neglect of him. But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſure can be more highly reſonable, than for poor Creatures, who are nothing without God, and neither have nor can hope for any thing but from his Bounty, readily, to deliver up all their concerns into his Hands, with all the thankfulleſt acknowledgments that may be of his unſpeakable Loving-kindneſs, in condeſcending to become their Guardian, to manage their Affairs for them ſo much more wiſely and to ſo much better advantage than themſelves could. This therefore is the former Branch of this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Duty, a ſteady Dependance upon God to take care of us in all our Streights.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>A quiet compoſure of Mind in all our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Exigencies,</hi> upon conſideration of the Care he takes of us. And could we but ſo <hi>caſt our Care upon God,</hi> as not to have it ſtill remaining upon our ſelves any farther than is requiſite in order to the gracious Deſigns of his Providence towards us, this would neceſſarily diſpoſe us <hi>not to take thought for the morrow;</hi> to forbear fretting and tormenting our ſelves with a fearful expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what poſſibly may happen hereafter, and yet withal, poſſibly may not; and would enable as on the contrary, heartily to rejoice that we are
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54666:60"/>not left deſtitute, but have an infinitely good God to order all our Affairs for us. There is no better ſign of a perfect Dependance upon God, than a Mind prepared for all Events, and that fears not to be miſerable whilſt in his Hands, though in the midſt of outward Dangers and Diſtractions; nor any thing that tends more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally to our preſent ſatisfaction.</p>
                        <p>This is the moſt ſovereign Antidote againſt that endleſs Solicitude which the worldly-wiſe Men too often labour under. And whoſoever ſets himſelf in good earneſt to make tryal of it, beſides that he acts like a good Chriſtian, and takes care for Eternity, he will find himſelf to have moreover laid the beſt Foundation for his own Happineſs in this World. Wherein, though he cannot expect to be wholly freed from Troubles, he will certainly be enabled to bear them with much the greater alacrity, by reaſon of the aſſurance he has, that God on whom he truſts, knows how to over-rule them all to his advantage.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore it was no unaccountable flight of fancy in the Emperor <hi>Antoninus,</hi> but the reſult of a ſerious Contemplation of the Inſtability of all earthly Enjoyments, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes,<note n="*" place="margin">

And being thus made ſenſible of his own Inſufficiency, and taught to place his Confidence in God as a ſure Defence againſt all aſſaults, it is hardly conceivable, that whatever Misfortunes ſhould make any laſting impreſſion upon him. For having learned to betake himſelf to God for ſhelter, whenſoever any thing of this nature appears, he is ſoon convinced that he needs no longer perplex himſelf about it, becauſe his God having undertaken for him, he knows aſſuredly it ſhall never hurt him. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he may have it ſpeedily removed; but if not, he will not ſuffer himſelf to be terrify'd at it, but will rather conſider, that it would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be permitted to lie upon him, but for ſome juſt and weighty Reaſon, and ſome way or other for his own benefit.</p>
                        <p>Thus therefore we are <hi>to caſt our Care upon God,</hi> by doing what we are able for our own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and then humbly and faithfully depending upon his Providence for the Event. We muſt ſee to moderate and reſtrain our Deſires, and to uſe the beſt means we can for obtaining them, muſt do what is in our power, muſt pray to God for what is above it, and muſt be ſure to ſerve and obey him, and to ſhun as much as in us lies, whatever might with-hold him from granting our Requeſts. And then, but not till then, may we ſafely comfort our ſelves, with a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54666:61"/>firm perſuaſion that God will certainly be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of us, and of our Affairs; and that we need not therefore torment our ſelves upon either of theſe accounts. For although he will not be pleaſed with a fruitleſs reliance upon him, a ſtupid neglect of all our concerns, that he alone may take care of us; yet if we labour aright to entitle our ſelves to his Protection; that is to ſay, if we curb our unreaſonable Deſires, and in all reſpects uſe the beſt means we can for getting thoſe ſatisfied that are reaſonable, we need not doubt but his Kindneſs will be extended to us. Let us but acquit our ſelves well in theſe Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and we may thenceforward freely depend upon it, that he will beſtow upon us all that he ſhall ſee neceſſary for us; and therefore that we ſhall have no cauſe to be overwhelmed with Fear or Grief, <hi>ſorrowing as men without hope,</hi> how hard ſoever our Condition be, but at our loweſt ebb may look upon it as a mighty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, that we have a moſt gracious God to concern himſelf for us, and on whom we may at any time <hi>caſt our Care,</hi> and reſt ſecure that he will <hi>take Care of us</hi> when we do ſo.</p>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54666:65"/>for Soul or Body, for our ſelves or ours, is a Duty practiſed and required by the Prophets of old, and by our Saviour and his Apoſtles ſince, together with great Promiſes annex'd and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies vouchſafed to it, and with Threatenings on the contrary, and dreadful Judgments inflicted, when Men have refuſed to behave themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. And now to apply this Doctrine a little more particularly, though very briefly.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If a plain expreſs Command require our Obedience, here is a Duty poſitively enjoyned, and not once or twice, or only by the by (tho' this too were enough ſufficiently to notifie our Maker's Will) but divers times, and upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occaſions, in multitudes of places in the Old Teſtament in our Saviour's Divine Sermon on the Mount, and in the Writings of his Apoſtles. Inſomuch that it is impoſſible for them who have any reverence for the Authority of Almighty God, any regard for his undoubted and oft re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Commands, to refuſe in any caſe to put their Truſt in him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If Promiſes of Bleſſings annex'd to a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful performance of this Duty can engage us to the Exerciſe of it, we have theſe likewiſe, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Bleſſedneſs in general, and again more particularly of Life, of ſecurity from dangers, of peace and quiet of mind, of ſucceſs in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and of a competent ſupply of the good things of this World. Whence to the neceſſary Obligations that lie upon us in point of duty to our Lord, here is added likewiſe very good encouragement with reſpect to our preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns whereby the rather to invite us to what is thus earneſtly preſſed upon us. And this medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation muſt therefore be a farther aggravation of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54666:66"/>their Diſobedience, who can find in their hearts to live in contradiction to it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If the Denunciation, or Execution of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments upon any that have been remarkably diſtruſtful of the Divine Protection may ſerve to awaken Perſons into a better dependance upon God for the future; the Hiſtory of the Jewiſh Nation in the Old Teſtament preſents us with a large Catalogue of heavy Judgments inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that murmuring and diſcontented People.<note place="margin">

                     <p n="4">4. If the Paterns of holy Men before our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Incarnation, and of the Apoſtles and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers afterwards, and even of our bleſſed Lord himſelf, that unſpotted Exemplar of an intire ſubmiſſion to his Father's Will, can perſuade us to the imitation of their unwearied dependance upon God for the gracious Completion of all his Promiſes, theſe are to be met with in great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and great abundance throughout the word of God; and will therefore mightily ſhame us, if we ſteer another courſe, to God's diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and our own prejudice at leaſt, perhaps to our utter Ruine.

And we muſt leave our ſelves intolerably inexcuſable, if we are
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54666:66"/>backward to attend to them there only, where they manifeſtly challenge, and juſtly deſerve our moſt ſerious Attention.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Laſtly, If the inſinite Glories conſequent upon the obſervance of this, as well as of the other Duties of our Religion can inflame our Souls with an ardent Deſire after them, we have here another eſpecial Motive to a conſcientious Practice of it. We have a recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſet before us that can never be ſufficiently valued, <hi>an exceeding and eternal weight of glory,</hi> but which is never to be attained to without a ſure Truſt in God's Mercy, and a ſteady Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon him <hi>to take care of us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And what now can any poſſibly imagine ſhould excuſe their neglect of a Duty, whereto all are thus indiſſolubly obliged and are ſo many ſeveral ways invited? Who can hope to approve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before God, whilſt he refuſes to hearken to his Voice, and be governed by him? Who can think to be ſafe in this World, that wilfully neglects the only means of his ſecurity? Or who can promiſe himſelf to be happy hereafter?

As if the ſame Almighty Power which at firſt made all things, could not at leaſt as eaſily preſerve them all in Being and good Order, when made; or as if the ſame boundleſs Goodneſs which invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the greater, would not invite as prevalently to the leſs. And no leſs abſurd are they who believe that God governs the World, and that all things are brought to paſs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Diſcretion of his Infinite Wiſdom, and yet will not be induced to caſt their Care upon him. For if thoſe argued unphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophically, theſe I am ſure act very unchriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, very unagreeably to the Principles of their moſt holy Religion, and very dangerouſly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54666:67"/>to their own intereſt both Temporal and Eternal.</p>
                     <p>And, oh that Men would therefore be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſeriouſly to weigh with themſelves, how undutiful they are to Almighty God, whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they refuſe to put their whole Concerns into his hands, and what deadly Enemies to themſelves. Let us remember what it is to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt his Care of us, that it is no leſs than to call his Veracity into queſtion, and to ſlight that Infinite Authority by vertue whereof he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to rely upon him in all conditions, and that unſpeakable Goodneſs which inclines him to take care of us; and that the inevitable Conſequence of ſuch a complicated Wickedneſs muſt needs be very terrible.</p>
                     <p>Had God but barely offered his free Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to every one that would humbly ſeek to him for it, this one would think ſhould have been charm enough to have induced all that had any ſenſe of his kindneſs, or any tolerable regard for their own Welfare, to betake themſelves im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the ſhelter of his Wings. And they that had neglected it, could have blamed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only for all the Evils which they had foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly brought upon themſelves, by not thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully embracing ſo ſingular a Favour. But when beſides this he hath farther condeſcended to back all his Propoſals of this Nature with his poſitive and frequent Commands, and his known Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon the Contemners of them, ſtill to keep at diſtance from him, cannot but be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerably heinous Provocation.

                     <p>And in God's Name what is it we propound to our ſelves when we act thus inconſiſtently with the Principles we profeſs to be governed by?

                        <p>But then as Mankind are more nearly related to himſelf, being made after his likeneſs, and deſigned for the perpetual enjoyment of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Preſence, it is very reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that they ſhould have a particular Intereſt in his Care. And thus much therefore our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour (as I have already hinted in part) teaches in his Sermon upon the Mount, diſſuading from an eager ſolicitude for the things of this Life, as from the Experience we have had of God's Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to our ſelves, in giving us our Beings, ſo likewiſe from the regard he has for the <hi>Birds,</hi> and other meaner parts of the Creation.<note n="*" place="margin">S.

                           <hi>Take no thought for your life,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>what ye ſhall eat, or what ye ſhall drink, or for the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, what ye ſhall put on;</hi> for theſe following Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:
<list>
                              <item>1. Becauſe <hi>the Life is more than Meat, and the Body than Raiment.</hi> Whereby is intimated,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54666:71"/>that God who hath already vouchſafed us the better, will not refuſe us the leſs; having given us <hi>life,</hi> he will not deny us thoſe things which are requir'd for its ſupport. <hi>He ſpake the word, and we were made; he commanded, and we were created;</hi> and dare any ſay, that he will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to order a due proviſion for thoſe to whom he hath thus bountifully given a Being? It is eaſie to believe, that his intent in producing us was not that we might pine away with inſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable hunger, or parch with inſupportable thirſt, or that we might ſtarve for want of ſomething to ſhelter us from the cold; and that therefore he will not let us languiſh under any of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies longer than he ſees very good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it. Having beſtowed upon us <hi>Life,</hi> which is a much greater bleſſing than <hi>Meat</hi> for it, and a <hi>Body</hi> which is far more valuable than the <hi>Raiment</hi> we put upon it, and the production whereof was a far greater work of his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence than a ſupply of theſe things is, there is no cauſe to fear that theſe ſhall not alſo be added to thoſe other in a due proportion.</item>
                              <item>2. Becauſe he takes care of the Birds to give them their Meat in due ſeaſon. For ſo it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>Behold the fowls of the air, they ſow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feedeth them; are ye not much better than they?</hi> As much as to ſay, <hi>Since you are certainly of far more account with God than the Fowls, and yet he makes ſuch plentiful proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for them, your own Reaſon will enform you, that he will much leſs neglect your ſelves.</hi>
                              </item>
                              <item>3. Becauſe his Providence extends it ſelf to the <hi>Flowers of the Field</hi> as well as to the Birds, for theſe alſo are delicately cloathed by him. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54666:71"/>the Lilies of the Field how they grow, they toyl not, neither do they ſpin; and yet I ſay unto you, that even</hi> Solomon <hi>in all his glory was not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed like one of theſe. Wherefore, if God ſo cloath the Graſs of the Field, which to day is, and to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is caſt into the Oven, ſhall be not much more cloath yeu, O ye of little faith.</hi> Where our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſtill proceeds, <hi>à fortiori,</hi> as in the former caſe, only that he doth it with more advantage, arguing, that the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God manifeſted in this lower rank of Creatures ought to convince every one, what reaſon there is to conclude, that he will much rather multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his Bleſſings upon Mankind, whom he hath created of a nobler Race, and to whom he hath all along profeſſed much greater kindneſs. And indeed it is not conceiveable, that he will take care, not only of the Beaſts, but of the Birds too, and even of thoſe little inconſiderable Birds, the Sparrows (as I noted before) that<note n="*" place="margin">

Which he did to a very extraordinary degree in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and firſt Diſciples of our Lord, inſpiring
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54666:81"/>them with that wonderful Magnanimity and Conſtancy amidſt their heavieſt preſſures, that <hi>when they were troubled on every ſide,</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us,<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 4.8, 9.</note>

                        <p n="3">3. He will deliver them from thoſe Evils, which poſſibly may for the preſent lie heavy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. He may permit them for a while to labour under Preſſures and Diſturbances, for the trial of their Faith, or the exerciſe of their Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or the mortification of their Luſts, or the quickening their Devotions, or to teach them how to value his Mercies when they have them, or to humble them under a ſenſe of their own Weakneſs and Inſufficiency, or to wean their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from this Life and its Enjoyments, and put them upon a diligent preparation for a better, or for whatſoever other wiſe Purpoſe and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign (as I ſhall ſhew<note n="†" place="margin">Chap. 4.

                           <hi>The Righteous cry, and the Lord heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles. The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and will ſave ſuch as be of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite ſpirit. Many are the afflictions of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, but the Lord delivereth him out of all. He keepeth all his bones, not one of them is broken. Evil ſhall ſlay the wicked, and they that hate the Righteous ſhall be deſolate. The Lord redeemeth the Soul of his Servants, and none of them that truſt in him ſhall be deſolate.</hi> Here is a plain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of God's concern for thoſe that faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <hi>caſt their Care upon him,</hi> together with a full and free Promiſe of his Protection, that he is and will be their Keeper, and they ſhall not be deſtitute of help, be the troubles that encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs them never ſo many.</p>
                        <p>And thus I have inſtanced in ſome few of thoſe many Texts of Scripture, which might have been urged, to prove, That God will have an eſpecial regard to them that love, and fear, and put their truſt in him, and will in his wiſe Providence ſo over-rule natural Cauſes and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, as<note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 8.28.</note> that <hi>all things ſhall</hi> be made to <hi>work together for their good.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I grant, that theſe forementioned, or other the like Expreſſions in Scripture, do not import, that good Men are to meet with no Troubles or Afflictions, whilſt they remain in this World, and partake of the ſame nature with other Men, and according to the ordinary courſe of things are in ſome reſpects, and eſpecially at ſome times more expoſed to them than others, and have ever and anon great need of them. For to affirm this, were not only to contradict each one's daily Experience, and all thoſe Promiſes of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54666:82"/>ſupport under Sufferings, which plainly ſuppoſe the beſt of Men liable to ſtand in need of this Support, and conſequently obnoxious to thoſe Sufferings which call for it; but beſides, it were to reflect upon Almighty God, as if he had not that regard for our welfare, which he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf to have. And we are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to perſuade our ſelves, that he will never permit his faithful Servants to endure any kind of Afflictions, though never ſo neceſſary and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient; but only that he will conſider their condition, and will not let them groan under more and heavier Calamities than he knows to be uſeful for them. For to keep them from ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Sufferings, is not a favour to them, but may prove a very great diskindneſs, and cannot therefore be the meaning of thoſe many profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which he makes from time to time, of this willingneſs to take care of them Thus much then, and no more, we may conclude from theſe and the like Declarations of God's concern for them that conſcientiouſly ſerve and depend upon him, that he will take continual care of them, and will give them as much eaſe and quiet as is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their Circumſtances, as much eaſe from Sufferings, and as much quiet under them.</p>

For one of theſe two Conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons muſt neceſſarily be made, of God's ſuffering the Righteous to be at any time in a ſtate of Affliction, either that he doth not watch over them according to his word, or elſe that it is out of kindneſs to them that he lets them be in this condition. And ſince the former of theſe is by no means to be imagined concerning a God of infinite Mercy and Truth, the other therefore muſt be owned as the true cauſe of their Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, namely, that God in his infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom obſerves it to be for their benefit, that they be expoſed to Tryals and outward Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. And by conſequence, they ought in this caſe to reſt ſatisfy'd, that though themſelves do not, yet God Almighty certainly knows the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying their Requeſts will be a greater favour to them, than the granting them would be.

What Opinion we ought to have of our Afflictions, namely, that we are to look upon them as the neceſſary Chaſtiſements of an Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Parent, who would not ſend them unleſs our Caſe called for them, and who will however be ready to turn them into Bleſſings to us, if we but mind to bear them as we ought. And if he let us lie under them only at ſuch times when they may be advantageous to us, inſomuch that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54666:86"/>it is beſt for us not to be delivered from them, what monſtrous undutifulneſs and ingratitude muſt it be to complain of this tender uſage? Conſidering how little reaſon there is for any kind of diſſatisfaction upon this account, we ſhould be prepared rather to bleſs, and praiſe, and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our gracious God, for vouchſafing us theſe ſeaſonable Medicines for the cure of our diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered Souls. We might very well reſolve to be patient and contented under the ſoreſt Troubles that God at any time thinks fit to bring us into, upon the account of that ſupport we may juſtly hope for from him, whilſt they are ſuffered to lie upon us. But we ſhould be even ready to rejoice in them, when we call to mind the good that may redound to us from them, if not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by our own imprudence.

For if God chaſtiſe us not but for our good, if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults our welfare, not only when he beſtows this World's Bleſſings upon us, but when he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws them from us likewiſe, and not only when he loads us with outward good things, but even when his hand lies heavieſt upon us, if in all his Diſpenſations of whatſoever nature he intend our benefit, what folly may be compared to

And what abundant reaſon have we therefore heartily to rejoice at the thoughts of ſo compaſſionate a Protector, and to fly to him for ſhelter in all our ſtreights? As we can never be happy without his Favour, how large a ſhare ſoever we have of the things of this life; ſo, on the contrary, there is no danger of being miſerable, ſo long as he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to provide for us, whatſoever either Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers may threaten, or Troubles, or Misfortunes may befall us.

Our gracious Lord hath often fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Counſels, and brought their ſubtileſt Devices to nought, and hath from time to time (as we hope he will now again) put a period to our Deſtractions.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If we look upon our ſelves as Members of a lately flouriſhing Kingdom, we have great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be thankful alſo upon this account. We have been very ready to complain of our Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance as a burden; ſuch plenty of worldly Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings has been vouchſafed us. And what Plots and Contrivances have been on foot for our over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw have generally proved abortive; and for the moſt part have fallen upon the Authors own Heads. It is true, we were ſuffered not very long ſince to prevail againſt our ſelves, till we had made an unhappy interruption of our Peace and Settlement for divers years together. Yet (behold the Goodneſs of our God) he then heard, at length, the cry of his diſtreſſed Servants, and reſtored quiet to our Land, together with all thoſe outward Comforts that uſually attend it. And ſince this, we may remember, that not many years agoe, ſcarce any part of <hi>Europe</hi> enjoyed ſo long and advantageous a Peace as we did, there being very few of our Neighbours who were not

And yet, oh! our gracious, our compaſſionate God, how boundleſs is thy Loving-kindneſs to us upon each of theſe accounts! Our Lives and Limbs, our Memory and Underſtanding, our Health and Strength, our Food and Raiment, and all the common Mercies we receive, we are too too apt to undervalue, becauſe of our ſo conſtant enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them; yet theſe are Bleſſings that they who want, or are about to loſe them, know how
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54666:91"/>to eſteem at a great rate. And how plentifully, I had almoſt ſaid, how inceſſantly are theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to us? If we have now and then a reſtleſs Night, have we not many, very many good ones for it? If we have loſt one Child, or other dear Relation, how many more have we yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? If we have been deprived of any other outward Enjoyment or Advantage, are not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others continued to us, or elſe ſucceed in the room of what is loſt? Or if we have one Limb diſtorted, or in pain, or periſhed, are not all our other parts preſerved in health and good order? Or if our Condition be yet harder, if we have loſt an only Child, or have loſt our beſt Friends, upon whom poſſibly we had great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, or have loſt our whole Eſtate or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, or whatſoever we are wont to value moſt, or have our whole Body diſordered with Pains or Sickneſs, how hard ſoever our Lot may be in any one or more of theſe Particulars, are we not ſafe as to the reſt? Why then ſhould any amongſt us ſuffer his Wants or Diſappointments in one kind, to take away his ſenſe of the many other Favours that he yet enjoys? eſpecially ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe are ordinarily many more, much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and more laſting?</p>
                        <p>Whereto, if I add the numerous Evils from which we are each day delivered (foraſmuch as we have no ſecurity that the next Houſe we come into ſhall not fall and bury us in its Ruines, the next bit of Meat we eat ſhall not choke us, the next breath of Air we take ſhall not breed ſome mortal Diſtemper in us, the next unruly Beaſt we meet with ſhall not prove our Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but only from God's good Providence watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over us) and thoſe other more imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,

                           <pb n="89" facs="tcp:54666:92"/>This was his ſupport, that how many, or how powerful ſoever his Enemies might be, the Lord who dwelleth on high, and who had hitherto been infinitely propitious to him, was mightier than them all by far; whoſe wonted Goodneſs had encouraged him to believe, that he ſhould not fail of being reſcued out of the hand of whomſoever that might riſe up againſt him.

                        <p>And the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> makes the ſame Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from the Conſideration of God's Mercy in the preſervation of himſelf and his Fellow-Diſciples,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54666:93"/>declaring how, when they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with many and dreadful terrours, which would otherwiſe have inevitably driven them paſt all hope of eſcaping, they found the remembrance of God's former Protection, a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial ſufficient to bear up their Spirits, that they ſhould not ſink under the weight of the worſt of Evils that might befall them, though it were even the cruelleſt ſort of death.<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 1.10.</note> 
                           <hi>Who hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered us,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>from ſo great death, and doth deliver us, in whom we truſt that he will yet deliver us.</hi> And at another time he ſpeaks to the ſame purpoſe, with a more particular reſpect to himſelf, and the ſucceſs of his Doctrine.<note n="†" place="margin">2 Tim. 4.17, 18.</note> 
                           <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Lord ſtood by me and ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the</hi> Gentiles <hi>might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the Lion, and the Lord ſhall deliver me from every evil work.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And thus ought every good Chriſtian to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage himſelf in his God, by calling to mind the many ſignal inſtances of his willingneſs to take care of himſelf, and others in their diſtreſs. A ſenſe of his marvellous Loving-kindneſs both in this and other reſpects ſhould engage perſons faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to depend upon him, as their beſt ſecurity in the time of trouble. It ſhould diſpoſe us all to weigh ſeriouſly with our ſelves, how unequal a return it is for all his Favours, to let them ſlip out of our minds, and leave us in fear, leaſt he ſhould no longer take care of us. And accordingly we ſhould rather argue thus with our ſelves: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever our preſent fears or troubles are, have we never known any in as bad a condition, whom God hath yet of his infinite Mercy delivered from it? Nay, poſſibly this may not be the firſt time
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54666:93"/>that our ſelves have been reduced to theſe ſtreights, and yet at length the Storm has blown over, the Air cleared, and we have had a way made for our eſcape; and perhaps with that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that we have found our ſelves in better circumſtances than ever before; as Trees are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily obſerved to ſettle the firmer, and take the better root for being ſhaken by the Winds, and a broken Limb when ſet again is generally reported to be ſtronger than if it never had been amiſs.</p>
                        <p>How then can we be ſo ungrateful, ſo undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful to our merciful Deliverer, as to refuſe to put our Truſt in him ſtill? How ſhould we dread the thoughts of making no better a Return for all his exceſſive Loving-kindneſs: It were certainly a much properer courſe, more reverent and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in relation to Almighty God, and tending more to our own ſecurity, whatever we ſuffer, whatever we fear, whatever we have deſerved by our Sins, whatever ſorrows may either threaten, or have overtaken us, nevertheleſs <hi>to remember the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of the Lord, and the wonders he has wrought,</hi> and as <hi>to talk of his doings,</hi> ſo moreover to make uſe of them for inviting both our ſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to a ſteady and unwearied dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. The conſideration hereof may ſerve to quicken our Devotions, and make us the more importunate ſuitors to Almighty God for relief againſt our Troubles, and may alſo engage us to offer up a hearty Sacrifice of Praiſe to him for all his Goodneſs; but it ſhould by no means ever ſuffer us to deſpair of a ſeaſonable redreſs from him, though in the moſt calamitous Condition.</p>
                        <p>It will be utterly impoſſible to queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God can reſcue out of the greateſt Dangers
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54666:94"/>or Miſeries, when we obſerve how miraculouſly and how frequently he has done it in all times paſt. And it will be highly unreaſonable like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and intolerably diſingenuous to diſtruſt his favourable Inclinations after ſuch abundant expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of his readineſs to exerciſe his Bounty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions. And by conſequence, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but find our ſelves indiſpenſibly obliged to make this uſe of his wonted Compaſſion, that we be encouraged conſtantly to <hi>caſt our Care upon him,</hi> and under our greateſt ſtreights to look up to him for help, as well knowing that when all outward Comforts ceaſe, he can eaſily ſupply the want of them, and that he will not fail to do it for them that ſeriouſly and dutifully fly to him for ſhelter.</p>
                        <p>Thus have I endeavoured to prove, That God Almighty never ceaſes to exerciſe a gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence over the whole World, which, as it was at firſt produced, is alſo ſtill preſerved and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by his Wiſdom and Power, that he feeds the Beaſts, and Fowls, adorns the Flowers of the Field, and takes care of Man to that degree, that our very Hairs are numbred by him, and no Evil can poſſibly befall any of us without his notice, or lie heavier than he ſees fit, or laſt longer than he allows it; that beſides the general Providence which he exerciſes over the Sons of Men, and the Plenty of Bleſſings he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows indifferently upon both Good and Bad, he has farther condeſcended to promiſe a peculiar Protection to the Righteous, that he will watch over them in an eſpecial manner, to ſecure them againſt the manifold Evils which might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be in danger of overwhelming them; and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54666:94"/>again, laſtly, That the Experience of all Ages ſhews how willing and ready he has been to fulfill theſe his Promiſes to the terrour and confuſion of his Enemies, and the ſafety and ſupport of all that have put their Truſt in him. And now what greater aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance would any one deſire of a good Providence continually preſiding over us? Or what can any conſidering perſon poſſibly inferr from hence, but that it muſt be our own fault, if we groan under any unneceſſary Calamity or Diſaſter, or if we want any ſuitable Good, ſince we are hence ſufficiently informed, that our God will never be backward to relieve us in either of theſe caſes, unleſs we ſenſelſly provoke him to it. We have all the Encouragement that can be deſired to rely upon him, upon the account of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to aſſiſt us when we do ſo. And if we but take care to approve our ſelves to him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by entitle our ſelves to his Promiſes, there is no room left to imagine, that he will be wanting to us in any reſpect.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> The Uſefulneſs of Caſting all our Care upon God.</head>
                     <p>THE Fourth thing I undertook was, <hi>To inſtance in ſome of the great Advantages that would accrue to us from a faithful and conſtant Dependance upon God.</hi> That the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty has required this Duty at our Hands, and from time to time, and in ſuch a manner as ſhews him nearly concerned for it, were Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough one would think to oblige all who deſire either to pleaſe him here, or to be happy with him hereafter, to an uninterrupted Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon him. And were the Duty thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by him, never ſo difficult in it ſelf, never ſo contrary to the natural Inclinations of Fleſh and Blood, and were it perpetually attended with the moſt formidable Dangers, or heavieſt Sufferings, yet being abſolutely neceſſary, no good Chriſtian but would conclude himſelf near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned, to encounter all theſe inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, rather than expoſe himſelf to the juſt indignation of Almighty God. But if the caſe be quite of another nature, and this neceſſary Duty have none of thoſe frightful Difficulties at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it, but be agreeable to the dictates of Reaſon, and for our Benefit in this life, as well as for the glory of God, and a means of our future Happineſs, there remains no pretence of an excuſe for the neglect of it. And that this
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54666:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>is the true ſtate of the matter, I hope I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in a good meaſure made apparent, and ſhall now proceed to prove it more fully, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Uſefulneſs of this Vertue, for theſe three following purpoſes;
<list>
                           <item>1. For obtaining a greater Intereſt in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Protection.</item>
                           <item>2. For quieting our Minds in all Conditions.</item>
                           <item>3. For Entitling to a better ſtate, when we ſhall be tranſlated hence.</item>
                        </list>

                        <p n="1">I. THIS Duty is of ſingular uſe <hi>for obtaining a greater Intereſtion the Divine Protection.</hi> For as to diſtruſt God, and not dare to rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in times of Danger and Neceſſity, is the way to offend him, and by this means to have our likelieſt Undertaking miſcarry for lack his Bleſſing; ſo on the contrary, there is no furer Expedient for compaſſing our juſt and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ends, and promoting our own Welfare, than to ſeek an Intereſt in him by an undaunted De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon his Providence, what our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaith in another caſe, being applicable alſo to this, That<note n="*" place="margin">

                        <p>It is a ſight highly pleaſing to God, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his poor Creatures ſenſible of their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency and flying to him for ſhelter, and his Bowels are preſently moved towards them. And if their Caſe be preſſing, and themſelves lay no impediment in the way, he will find out a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod for their relief, as he did for<note n="*" place="margin">2 Chron. 13.17, 18.</note>

                        <p>Thus it is recorded alſo of <hi>Job,</hi> that<note n="†" place="margin">Job 1.14, &amp;c.</note> when it had pleaſed God to bring him into a very low condition, having deprived him of his Children, and his Wealth, and his Health and ſoundneſs of Body, ſo that<note n="‖" place="margin">c. 2.8.</note>

                           <q>But what ſhall we ſay then to the Caſe of ſuch, whoſe Sufferings have been as eminent as their Piety? His it not been often ſeen, that the beſt Men, who have been moſt obſervant of their Duty in all reſpects, and in particular, have moſt firmly truſted in God, have however met with a very troubleſome paſſage through this World? Our bleſſed Saviour foretold to his Apoſtles and other Diſciples, that they muſt be expoſed to manifold Tribulations du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their abode here. And it is undeniable, that the firſt propagators of our Faith, and the Martyrs in the ſucceeding Ages of the Church, underwent a large ſhare of obloquy and reproach, contempt and diſgrace, being <hi>hated of all men for his name's ſake,</hi> and were made to ſubmit to the utmoſt hardſhips, and to the cruelleſt and moſt frightful ſorts of death. And others who have not been called to bear ſo remarkable a Teſtimony to our Saviour's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, have, notwithſtanding all their Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God, laboured under loſſes and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, wants and troubles of divers kinds, as though they had been forſaken of him. And how ſhall we reconcile theſe Men's Sufferings to God's continual Care of all that truſt in him?</q> This Difficulty I have<note n="*" place="margin">C. 3. Sect. 1. p. 57, &amp;c.</note> already, in a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, removed, but ſhall endeavour farther to clear it from theſe three following Obſervations.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. A good Man may have Sufferings of that nature, that no Dependance upon God can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be ſuppoſed to ſhelter him againſt them.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54666:99"/>He may poſſibly bring himſelf into trouble, by his own inadvertence, by not taking care to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himſelf of, or not duly applying himſelf to the means that are proper in order to his welfare. Some overſight or other miſcarriage of his own may have been the natural occaſion of his misfortunes; and then it is very juſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that God ſhould permit him for a while to groan under them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. God may be pleaſed to lay his hand upon good Men, not out of diſpleaſure, or unkindneſs, or neglect of them, but for other wiſe reaſons of his own, (ſome of which I ſhall have occaſion to inſtance in<note n="*" place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> hereafter, and therefore forbear to mention them at preſent) and may ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them for it another way. Which was the caſe of the Apoſtles and firſt Diſciples, and other Saints, Confeſſors, and Martyrs, who were to be eſpecial Inſtruments of God's glory, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating his Fear and Worſhip amongſt Mankind, and had no cauſe to think themſelves forſaken of him, though their Fidelity to him coſt them dear; becauſe they had an unconceivably valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Crown aſſigned them in the other life, as a Recompence for what they ſhould undergo upon this account. Hence it was that they ſcorned to be affrighted at the ſharpeſt Trials, rejoicing, on the contrary, when they were counted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to ſuffer for our Saviour's ſake, triumphing at the thoughts of that incomparable Felicity, whereto they were ſhortly to be advanced, and which would not let them ſtick at any thing they ſaw neceſſary to be encountered in their way to it. At their loweſt and worſt eſtate they could have no more (indeed they had infinitely leſs) cauſe of complaint, than a Subject would have,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54666:99"/>who having been earneſtly ſoliciting his Prince for a profitable Office, ſhould meet with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, but withall ſhould at the ſame time have a free Eſtate beſtowed upon him of many times the value. And therefore they could by no means think themſelves neglected by God, ſeeing he had provided ſo rich a Reward for them. Nor are their Sufferings any evidence that he will not grant a ſuitable ſupply of the good things of this life to thoſe that live in more propitious times.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. God's Promiſes to them that rely upon him are not all of the ſame kind (as I have<note n="*" place="margin">C. 3 Sect. 2.</note> already ſhewn) but ſometimes of ſupport under Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, as well as of Deliverance from them at others. And his immenſe Power and Goodneſs may diſcover themſelves as much the one way as the other. The gracious influences of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence are ſeen, in carrying Men victoriouſly through the ſharpeſt Conflicts, taking off the edge of their Afflictions, and enabling them to ſuffer or die with chearfulneſs, no leſs than in preſerving them from theſe or other the like tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als. Thus he was with the Martyrs whom he did not forſake in their ſevereſt Agonies, but took an eſpecial care of them, enabling them to triumph over all the oppoſition they met with, to the confuſion of their moſt avowed Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. He did <hi>not leave them comfortleſs,</hi> but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred to them in a very ſignal manner, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them<note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 8.37.</note>

                        </p>
                        <p>So that as <hi>a little Philoſophy</hi> (as the Lord <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi>
                           <note n="‖" place="margin">Eſſay 16.</note> obſerves) <hi>inclineth a Man's Mind to Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, but depth in Philoſophy bringeth Mens Minds about to Religion;</hi> ſo here, though a ſuperficial
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54666:100"/>view of the Hardſhips and Tortures theſe Saints endured, may repreſent their caſe as very deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, a more perfect inſight into it will ſoon confute this notion, by manifeſting them to have had a ſingular intereſt in God's favour, and been his peculiar care; becauſe it could not otherwiſe have been that they ſhould ſo courageouſly bear up againſt thoſe multitudes of heavy preſſures, under which Fleſh and Blood muſt of it ſelf have inevitably ſunk.</p>
                        <p>The ſumme is, That God is always mindful of them that <hi>caſt their Care upon him,</hi> and always ready to aſſiſt them, though not always the ſame way. He ſuits his Kindneſs to Mens Truſt in him, and by how much the ſtronger and better ſettled this is, ſo much the more they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of his Relief. So that the leſs we depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our ſelves, and the more heartily we apply to him for Succour, in the better caſe we are at preſent; and are like, beſides, to be continually improving in his Favour, and hence to enjoy yet greater meaſures of ſtrength, and the more laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſafety. Which being the natural effect of a ſteady dependance upon God, the more our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in him increaſes, the more will his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for us increaſe; and the more his Concern for us increaſes, the more ſtill will our Confidence in him increaſe, till by degrees we find to our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable comfort, that there is no Security like truſting in him, no Life like living upon his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, no Support in evil times, no Eaſe, no Satisfaction, no Happineſs on this ſide Heaven, like <hi>caſting all our Care upon him.</hi>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54666:101"/>to be ſo. Experience convinces him of his own inability to determine his own portion either of Joy or Grief, Happineſs or Miſery, or to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a thouſand chances, which may happen to croſs his Deſigns, in ſpight of his utmoſt power and foreſight. When he has employed all his Skill and Dexterity, all his ingenuity, Wiſdom, and Prudence in laying a long train for compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Ends, he knows not what diverſity of unexpected accidents may make it miſcarry, at leaſt preventing its intended operation, perhaps giving it a quite contrary iſſue And whilſt he remains in this wavering uncertain ſtate, it is impoſſible he ſhould have any true enjoyment of himſelf, or whatſoever he moſt delights in.

So little influence had all their Sufferings upon them, when they ought much rather to have humbled them in the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt manner that might be for all thoſe ſins which had brought theſe Miſeries upon them.</p>
                        <p>From which, and other like Inſtances, we may learn, to what exceſs of unlimited Impiety Mankind are too prone to be carried on, when they ceaſe to attend to God's Chaſtiſements, and the End that he deſigns in them. It was a mighty aggravation of theſe Peoples Wickedneſs that they dared to allow themſelves in it at a time, when God in an eminent manner <hi>called to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldneſs, and to girding with ſack-cloath.</hi> When they ſhould have been moſt ſolemnly bewailing their Iniquities, and crying earneſtly to God for pardon, and ſhould have unfeignedly reſolved upon a better Obedience for the future, they took a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary courſe, as if they had no ſenſe at all of what they already endured, or what more they had cauſe to fear; and by this means highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked God to have plagued them yet much more ſeverely for all their Abominations. Which, though very offenſive, if they had been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at another ſeaſon, and in other circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, were in this caſe more intolerably ſo, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in them, together with their own natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral turpitude and immorality, an horrid abuſe alſo of the very means that God thought fit to make uſe of in order to their Reformation.</p>
                        <p>But it was far otherwiſe with the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> when the Prophet <hi>Jonah</hi> was ſent to forwarn
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54666:109"/>them of the Deſtruction that was preparing for them, and would ſpeedily overtake them, except they would amend their doings. For no ſooner was news hereof brought<note n="*" place="margin">Jon. 3.6, 7, 8.</note>

                        <p>And thus it was generally obſerved of the Heathen Mariners, that they were wont in their Diſtreſs, to pray, and make Vows to ſome of their ſuppoſed Deities, and upon their eſcape to bring their Oblations to the Temples in token of their Gratitude.</p>

This he accounted a great addition to all their other Wickedneſſes, and therefore lets them know, that they muſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expect to ſmart for it, if continued in.</p>

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54666:113"/>gone? It may be I can leave them a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Subſiſtence at my death. But if I cannot, why ſhould I be troubled, ſo I can but leave them God's Bleſſing, which is far better than any temporal Legacy I can pretend to give them. By an unreaſonable ſolicitude for them I may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend God, and ſo may wrong both my ſelf and them; but I am certain I have no way to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the welfare of either, like an unfeigned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of all my concerns to God's diſpoſal, and a quiet expectation of Safety and Happineſs from him alone.</p>
                        <p>This my concern for them may be very abſurd, and which would appear ſo to my ſelf, if I could but diſcover how Almighty God has determin'd to diſpoſe of thoſe I am ſo concerned for. It may be he deſigns that moſt or all of them ſhould die before me; and then it is certainly a very needleſs ſolicitude that I have for their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence after my death. It may be he ſees a mean beginning to be the beſt way for them to riſe and flouriſh in the World, and that if they had been more plentifully provided for at the firſt they would have been apt to grow idle and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant, and bring themſelves into greater ſtreights than they are like to meet with as they are. Or it may be again that he foreſees ſome other Proviſion will be made for them, which I am not ſenſible of, ſome Inheritance like to fall to them, or ſome kind Friend that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to take care of them, or to bequeath a bountifull Legacy to them, or that has an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and wants only a convenient oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of helping them to ſome place of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit that may maintain them. Or it may be God ſees a plentifull Proviſion of the things
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54666:114"/>of this life improper for them, and that they will do beſt, and be moſt mindfull of their duty, and moſt deſirous to work out the eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Souls in a low condition; and why then ſhould I trouble my ſelf with an unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table fear leaſt God ſhould deal more graciouſly by them than I would have deſired of him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the caſe be with them now, or whatever it is like to be ſome time hence, it is plain, all my ſolicitude cannot profit them againſt God's Will, but my Truſt in him <hi>to take care of them</hi> may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much profit both my ſelf and them. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the trueſt, the greateſt, and moſt laſting kindneſs I can do them, as to their temporal concerns is to leave them intirely to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal.</p>
                        <p>I confeſs, it is fit that each one endeavour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a prudent proviſion for himſelf and any that depend upon him, as he ſhall have opportunity. But when he doth what he can in this reſpect, it is very unreaſonable and abſurd not to caſt all farther Care upon God, but <hi>to take</hi> as much <hi>thought for the morrow,</hi> as if he had none but himſelf to take care of him.<note n="*" place="margin">

There is nothing ſerves more naturally to affright perſons from ſin, and to make them indefatigably induſtrious in the ways of Piety, than a continual ſenſe of God's Preſence with them, obſerving all their doings, to reward or puniſh them accordingly: For it is not eaſie to imagine, how they ſhould dare to indulge themſelves in any known iniquity when they call to mind that they are under his All-ſeeing Eye, and that not the leaſt of their miſcarriages can poſſibly eſcape his notice. This, if any thing in the World, will excite their utmoſt diligence in <hi>exerciſing themſelves to have always conſciences void of offence both towards God, and towards Man.</hi>

                        <p>But now this ſenſe of God's Preſence with us is no way ſo well kept up in our Souls, as by a continual reliance upon, and application to him for whatſoever we ſtand in need of. It can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be that we ſhould forget that infinite Being, to whom we are perpetually looking up for his Bleſſing, and whom we are taught to addreſs our ſelves to upon all occaſions for relief, but withall, whoſe Favour we are to hope for no longer than we are careful to obſerve his Will.</p>
                        <p>Whence it comes to paſs, that our very Wants and Calamities, Fears and Dangers become a
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:54666:115"/>means of our better Obedience, by reminding us of the Relation we ſtand in to Almighty God, the Benefits we receive from him, and the returns of Homage that he expects from us. For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever any may encourage themſelves in their Wickedneſs, whilſt they have eſtranged the thoughts of God from their Minds, they will very hardly know how to continue this their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs, when they remember they are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately going to offer up their Supplications to him, for ſome good thing they want at his Hands. The meditation hereof will make them aſhamed to diſpleaſe him, conſidering the daily Benefits his Bounty ſupplys them with; and afraid alſo to do it, leaſt ſo he ſhould be provoked to with-hold his Hand, and deny them what they come next to petition him for, or perhaps to ſend them away with a Curſe inſtead of a Bleſſing.</p>
                        <p>It is very ſerviceable likewiſe for affecting our Souls with a ſenſe of the numerous Bleſſings we daily partake of, and hereby for enflaming them with the love of our ſo infinitely generous Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, and an unfeigned gratitude to him for all his unſpeakable Loving-kindneſs. It teaches to ſue to him beforehand for what we need, and when we have obtained it, fills our Mouths with hearty Songs of Praiſe and Thankſgiving for it.</p>
                        <p>And by how much the eaſier it renders us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all Afflictions, ſo much the more it contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to a ready and chearfull performance of our Duty in all reſpects. It engages us to ſtudy <hi>what return we ſhall make the Lord, for all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits that he hath done unto us,</hi> and leaves us free to apply our ſelves to whatever acknowledgments we believe he looks for from us. By not ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

And being thus uſefull an Inſtrument in order to an holineſs of Converſation, it muſt neceſſarily be owned to be of great importance, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituling to an eternal ſtate of Happineſs.</p>

                        <p>Whereas, on the contrary, no ſooner hath a Man learned to repoſe his truſt in God, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a good Chriſtian, but he thenceforward undervalues all things elſe in compariſon of an Intereſt in his Favour.

And when things ſeem at worſt, it is a great eaſe to his Mind to reflect, that the Caſe may poſſibly be much better than it appears to him, there may be a means of eſcape that he is not aware of, or ſome conſiderable mitigation of his Fears or Sorrows which he is not ſenſible of, but which when he ſhall come to underſtand it, will give him cauſe to rejoice at what has befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len him.</p>
                        <p>Or come the greateſt hardſhip that can be, he is ſure of an ineffable, unconceivable recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for it, that if he be<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. ult.</note>

                        <p>So that upon the whole matter it is evident, that a conſcientious practice of this Duty is our readieſt means of ſecurity, againſt all Evils from whatſoever Quarter, our only <hi>Palladium,</hi> which whilſt we ſafely retain, there can be no danger of miſcarrying.

All-ſufficiency is to be found in none but the Almighty Creator, the beſt of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Beings being liable to manifold defects and imperfections, and depending wholly upon him for both their Subſiſtence and their Power of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration; and therefore to rely upon any thing elſe than him for ſafety, is but to <hi>truſt in the ſtaff of a broken reed, whereon, if a man lean it will go into his hand, and pierce it.</hi>

                        <p>All our Abilities, or whatſoever Advantages for helping our ſelves are but the Gift of God, and act in ſubordination to his Will and ſo far on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as he is pleaſed to give them leave.

                           <hi>His is the greatneſs, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majeſty; for all that is in the heaven and in the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54666:122"/>earth is his, his is the Kingdom, and he is exalted as head above all. Both riches and honour come of him, and he reigneth over all, and in his hand is power and might; in his hand it is to make great, and to give ſtrength unto all.</hi> Wherefore, ſince the Stream can in no caſe riſe above the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and in this caſe falls infinitely below it, it is very apparent, that all inferiour helps are not to be regarded any farther than the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence may be expected to promote their Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy; and that it is therefore an inſtance of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable weakneſs, for any to look no higher than theſe for ſafety, which are not more likely to anſwer our Deſigns when rightly improved, and with a due reverence to and dependance upon the firſt mover and cauſe of all things, than they are ſure to deceive ſuch as place all their Truſt in them.</p>
                        <p>And thus much Experience alſo teſtifies, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beyond all contradiction, that it is not Mens own foreſight, or labour, or outward advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of whatever kind that brings their purpoſes to effect, but the Bleſſing and Goodneſs of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God. For hence it comes to paſs,<note n="*" place="margin">Eccleſ. 9.11.</note> that <hi>the race is not always to the ſwift, nor the battel to the ſtrong; neither yet bread to the wiſe, nor yet riches to men of underſtanding, nor favour to men of skill, but time and chance happeneth to them all.</hi> God reſerves to himſelf a power to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe, and croſs, and alter the wonted courſe of things, whereby to awaken perſons to a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of himſelf, and dependance upon him, and therefore orders matters ſo, that though they uſually happen according to the probability of ſecond Cauſes, ſometimes they are obſerved to fall out quite otherwiſe. So that when Men
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:54666:123"/>have done all they can, and with the faireſt and reaſonableſt expectation of ſucceſs, they many times fail of their End they know not how.</p>
                        <p>There is a ſecret uncontroulable Providence that takes occaſion to preſent extraordinary opportunities, and offers advantages on the one hand, or lays impediments in the way on the other, which no humane Wiſdom could foreſee or provide againſt. And this gives ſucceſs to very unlikely Means, defeating the ſwift and the ſtrong, and the wiſe, and the politick, and them that are beſt verſed in Men and Buſineſs, baulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them of their Hopes, and fruſtrating their Deſigns. Whereas, if any Humane Means were of force enough to anſwer Men's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires without the help of a ſuperiour Power, it could not be that they ſhould ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſcarry, when in all appearance they are the beſt diſpoſed that can be. And this therefore is a plain proof of the vanity and folly of truſting to theſe, without having conſtant recourſe to Almighty God for his Bleſſing upon them, and reſting upon him to give them the deſired ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. Thus much in general.</p>
                        <p>But that the Inſufficiency of all Natural Means of Safety may be made yet more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, it will not be amiſs to deſcend to a more particular conſideration of them: And I take it they may be all reduced to theſe four Heads,

                        <p>Thus the Scripture teſtifies ſingle and confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Forces to be equal in relation to God's over-ruling Providence; but conſidered in themſelves, with reſpect to their own natural Capacities they are not ſo. For the latter have divers peculiar Inconveniencies attending them, which make them a far leſs probable Inſtrument of Safety than the other, unleſs counterpoiſed by Numbers, or ſome other remarkable Advantages. Perhaps they may not all be hearty in what they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. Or if they be, yet there may be points of Honour to be adjuſted amongſt their Officers, which may occaſion Differences amongſt them, or ſeparate Intereſts may be carrying on, each one endeavouring to favour his own Men, and lay the Burden rather upon his Allies. And at beſt, their Proceedings will be backwarder, their Counſels ſlower, and their Deſigns more liable to be diſcovered and prevented. Upon all which accounts there is leſs reaſon to promiſe our ſelves Security from any Aſſiſtances of this kind. God may bleſs the Means, and make them effectual to the Ends for which they are deſigned; but if he do, it is to his Bleſſing upon them, not to the Means themſelves without his Concurrence, that we are to aſcribe our Welfare.</p>

This is a good Preſervative from needleſs Fears, and a Preparative for Difficulties, and bold and hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Enterprizes, and hence many times turns to good account; but withall, it hath need of great Prudence to regulate it, and a proportionable Strength to ſupport it, or otherwiſe the effects of it may prove very ſad. If it grow exceſſive, and ſo degenerate into Raſhneſs, or if it meet with greater oppoſition than was expected and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt, it is a ready way to Ruine, by invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving men in dangers, out of which they are in no wiſe able to extricate themſelves. And at beſt it is but a feeble ſupport againſt any Adverſity,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54666:133"/>unleſs men had ſtrength of Body, and all other requiſite Qualifications, for carrying them through all the difficulties wherein it may engage them. It ſtirs them up to noble Atchievements, and when attended with good Succeſs in them is a means of their advancement at preſent, and perhaps of tranſmitting the laſting Fame of their daring Exploits to many Generations. But it is not always thus proſperous. And when it is, the Honour of it is due to Almighty God, for granting his Bleſſing to it, which had he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, it muſt neceſſarily have had a quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry event.</p>
                        <p>A miſtaken notion of Courage is a common (alas! God knows, too common) occaſion of needleſs and moſt miſchievous Quarrels and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, and ends in the deſtruction of ſuch as are apt to value themſelves moſt upon it. And when better underſtood, and uſed with more conſideration, and to better purpoſes, it is no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity againſt the multitudes of Evils whereto we are continually obnoxious, and muſt be whilſt we remain in this ſtate of Sin and Sorrows. It may preſerve from ſome diſadvantages, but it is well if it do not at other times expoſe to more and greater. And though it may be helpfull for obtaining ſome good, it may poſſibly more than counterbalance this by the miſchiefs it brings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Wiſdom. Of what conſtant uſe this is in the mangement of all Affairs, how Policy often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſupplies the defect of Strength or Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or whatſoever other Advantages, and how the want of it on the other hand is a likely cauſe of ruining the probableſt Undertakings, is too well known to need that I ſhould inſiſt upon it.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54666:134"/>Prudence, and Foreſight, and a good contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance before-hand, and a due attendance upon the Inconveniencies that there is moſt danger of meeting with in the proſecution of a Deſign, are of ſuch neceſſity in order to its ſucceſs, that nothing of difficulty can ordinarily be expected to be brought to a good concluſion without them. But where theſe concurr in any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable degree, they give a Man a ſtrange advantage for great and noble Undertakings.

Nor can they at any time be ſecurely relied upon, as an infallible proviſion againſt whatſoever dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or a ſure means of obtaining any good. They may give reaſonable grounds of hoping well, but leave us after all at great uncertainties, inaſmuch as the moſt quick-ſighted Obſerver can never diſcover all the ſecret Springs of Nature, and their ſeveral tendencies in relation to ſuch and ſuch an Action, much leſs can dive into the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathomable Deſigns of the Divine Providence in reſpect to it; which yet are neceſſary to be known before a right Judgment can be made of it.</p>
                        <p>It pleaſes God many times to cut off cunning and mighty Men in the height of their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when they think they have well nigh ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted all the Impediments they had to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with, and are upon the very point of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fruit of their Endeavours.

<list>
                              <item>1. Advice in our Streights.</item>

                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. Advice in our Streights. Now it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a friendly Office, and a conſiderable piece of Charity, to be ready at all times to counſel thoſe that are in Difficulties and Wants, and therefore ſeek for direction to deliver themſelves out of them. But it is plain, all Men are not capacitated to undertake this Office, becauſe, to perform it aright it is requiſite that the Adviſer be a Man of Prudence and Underſtanding, and that moreover, if it may be, he apprehend the Circumſtances of thoſe that want his Advice, at leaſt as to the Caſe they adviſe about. And when ſuch an one is found, it is poſſible he may be modeſt and unwilling to venture too far upon his own Judgment, and hence may be backward to ſpeak his Sentiments in matters of moſt Intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, and which therefore need his help moſt; or he may be wary and cautious, and loth to meddle with things that do not immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern himſelf; or he may have ſome Intereſt of his own depending, or ſome Deſign in hand, or a Relation to ſome Friend whom this Caſe may affect, which may make him partial in it, and not to give the beſt Advice he can. Or if none of theſe happen, but he be ready to ſpeak his Mind freely and openly, yet being but a Man, and therefore ſubject to manifold infirmities, he may
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54666:137"/>perhaps be miſtaken, in part at leaſt of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and by this means may prove a cauſe of much miſchief to the perſon, to whom he meant a kindneſs. Or if not this neither, but he gives the beſt, the fitteſt, the propereſt Advice that can be, ſtill this is but Advice, and can operate no farther than I am both capable and carefull to put it in practice. And yet if I knew how to follow it as I ought, it depends however upon God's Will, whether I ſhall reap the benefit from it, that I may in all appearance have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expect. It is ſcarce to be thought that I ſhould ask Counſel of a ſubtiler Politician than <hi>Achitophel,</hi> yet <hi>the Lord</hi> in his wiſe Providence<note n="*" place="margin">2 Sam. 17.14.</note> 
                           <hi>appointed to deſeat the good counſel of Achitophel, to the intent that the Lord might bring evil upon Abſalom,</hi> who had taken him for his director.</p>
                        <p>Every Man is not prepared to follow good Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, when freely and faithfully given him, any more than<note n="†" place="margin">2 King. 12.13.</note> 
                           <hi>Rehoboam</hi> was to hearken to the Counſel of the Old Men, for his rejecting where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the ten Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> revolted from him. And of thoſe that are, God may have (if not the ſame, yet ſome other) juſt reaſon to ſay, as he did of <hi>Syria, Ephraim,</hi> and the Son of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliah,</hi>

                           <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, it ſhall not ſtand, neither ſhall it come to paſs.</hi> And if he once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict it, there is nothing can withſtand his Power, or hold out againſt his Word. That which he reſolves, none can ever defeat, that it ſhall not certainly obtain its effect. One Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration paſſes away and another comes in its ſtead but his Purpoſes are ſtill immoveably the ſame and ſhall undoubtedly prevail throughout all Ages. Thus much the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> aſſures us in theſe words, <hi>The counſel of the Lord ſtandeth for ever,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54666:137"/>and the thoughts of his heart to all Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But Man's Imaginations, on the contrary, are but vain. His Directions may prove advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in ſome caſes, and when duly followed, but ſince there is no certainty that they will, it muſt be a very great weakneſs to rely upon them, as if there were.</p>
                        <p>A Phyſician may give the beſt Advice he can for his Patients recovery; but in ſome critical caſes he may miſtake the nature of his Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and order him an unſuitable and hurtful Medicine. And when his Preſcriptions are in all reſpects the moſt appoſite that may be, this ſignifies nothing, unleſs they be regularly atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to. And if they be moſt ſtrictly obſerved, it ſtill belongs to God to give a Bleſſing to them, which yet except he do, the Patient may be long enough before he receive any benefit from them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Defence againſt Troubles. When Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties apparently hover over us, ſome kind Friend may poſſibly ſtep in, and ward off the blow, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intirely or in part, or if a Wound be alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy given, may with the good<note n="*" place="margin">

And in the ordinary courſe of the World the diſparity is far greater, ſcarce one in a multitude of Spectators thinking it needfull to trouble himſelf about o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſons Sufferings, any farther than formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54666:138"/>to profeſs a ſorrow for them. And how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is the Ability of them that are more hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compaſſionate? Whilſt they are Men, ſubject to the Infirmities of Humane Nature, and liable to the manifold Misfortunes that uſually attend this frail uncertain Life, they cannot ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from Troubles, and are therefore at leaſt as unable to keep them off from others, how earneſtly ſoever they deſire, and endeavour it, and watch all opportunities for it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Support in our Needs. To feed the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, give Drink to the Thirſty, cloath the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, lodge the Stranger, and viſit the Sick and the Priſoner, is a neceſſary branch of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; ſo neceſſary, that our Bleſſed Lord to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs theſe Duties the more effectually upon the Minds of his Followers, and make them the more carefully obſervant of them, chooſes in his account of the laſt Judgment, to inſtance in the exerciſe or neglect of them, as the Criterion or Teſt whereby the Sheep and the Goats ſhall be diſcriminated, when they come to appear before his Tribunal. And none therefore who has any regard to the Obligations that lie upon him from his Religion, but will find himſelf nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to be frequently employing himſelf in Duties of this nature, as he ſhall have Ability, and ſhall meet with proper Objects for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. Or whereinſoever elſe he can be helpful to thoſe that need it, he will ſee a parity of Reaſon directing, not to omit a fair opportunity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing his Kindneſs to God's Glory, and his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Neighbour's Benefit.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheleſs it muſt be owned, that if a Man's own Poſſeſſions are but an imperfect fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble remedy againſt this Life's Inconveniencies, a
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:54666:138"/>Precarious dependent Subſiſtence by the Charity and Favour of others cannot be better. I wiſh I could ſay, it were not abundantly worſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that it is leſs eaſie to a Man's Mind, that it were not alſo far more uncertain, and leſs like to anſwer his Neceſſities.

Which being always an intolerable Abomination in his ſight, he therefore utterly diſallows of it in all caſes, as what can never be to his glory, though committed upon never ſo ſpecious a pretence. Though it were to preſerve a diſcountenanced Religion, or to ſave a ſinking Church, or upon any other the moſt weighty occaſion, he permits not a Lye to be told, much leſs an apparently ill Action to be done. And if
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:54666:143"/>it be not lawfull to ſpeak or act unrighteouſly for God, and with an intent to advance his Glory, who can conceive it ſafe to do it for our own ſakes, though in our moſt urgent Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?

Whilſt they are agreeable to his Will, they may be uſefull for our Deliverance, but when contrary to it, we may juſtly look that they ſhould hinder and prevent, rather than be a means of promoting it.

                           <hi>Morinus</hi> mentions a Tradition of one of the Rabbins, containing a peculiar method of God's puniſhing a greedy Worldling, who ſought to enrich himſelf by Sacrilege, and found himſelf at length to have been ſadly impoveriſhed by it. The Method he took was this; His Eſtate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving brought him in a thouſand Meaſures of Grain by the Year, inſtead of paying an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred for Tithe, he with-held ten, and pay'd on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ninety. Whereupon it pleaſed God to order, that the next Year, his Ground ſhould yeild him but nine hundred Meaſures, being juſt the quantity he had tithed for the Year before. Upon this he brings but eighty, and accordingly the next Year his Income was but eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; and ſo on, till it fell gradually to one hundred Meaſures in the whole, and might have come to leſs if he had not taken warning then, and penitently acknowledged his Offence, and reſolv'd upon an amendment for the future. I don't vouch for the truth of this Relation; but however it naturally hints to us, how eaſie it is for God to find out wicked Men, when they think themſelves moſt exquiſitely ſubtile and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate in their Iniquities, and to ſhew them how vain a matter it is to attempt the bringing their Deſigns about without him. All the pains that are taken in this caſe may be to no purpoſe, or to a very bad one, leaving perſons at laſt in as

                        <p>For to make uſe of any kind of Sin in order to our welfare, is a very prepoſterous courſe in relation to Almighty God, arguing an unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diffidence in him, as if he would prove worſe than his word, and would not take due care of us, notwithſtanding he hath ſo oft and ſo plainly declared he will. It implies a diſtruſt that either he cannot, or will not help us, and ſo calls either his Power, or elſe his Goodneſs and Veracity into queſtion. Whence it muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily appear to be an act of high Diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity and Undutifulneſs; and conſequently to be utterly unbecoming our Chriſtian Profeſſion. It is at beſt but a doing ill with a good intent. And how diſhonourable this is to Almighty God, and how dear it is like to coſt the Doer, unleſs prevented by a ſincere Repentance, may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from thoſe words of the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul,</hi>

                        <p>Thus it pleaſes the great God to execute his Wrath in an extraordinary and ſignal manner, when Men grow audacious and incorrigible in their Wickedneſs, and provoke him to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that he can no longer bear with them. All the preſent ſucceſs ſuch meet with is no ſecurity to them againſt a more deadly ſtroke, when the meaſure of their Iniquities is filled up. This is the proper ſeaſon for him to vindicate his own Honour and Juſtice, and to let themſelves and the reſt of the World ſee, that he is not an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned Spectator of their doings. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he takes occaſion many times to inflict ſome immediate Judgment upon them; or elſe he makes ſome other way for his Indignation, which, if attended to, muſt neceſſarily convince them of their folly, in having departed from his Precepts, how inviting ſoever the temptation might have appeared to them.</p>
                        <p>And if we appeal to the ordinary courſe of the World, it muſt be acknowledged, that though a Man may contrive to advance himſelf for the preſent (which yet is more than many can do with all their Cunning, and all their Wickedneſs) though a Man may contrive, I ſay, to advance himſelf for the preſent, by Cheating, Oppreſſion, Sycophantry, Perjury, Subornation, Time-ſerving, or other evil Practices; theſe ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom laſt long without recoiling upon him to his ſorrow.

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:54666:151"/>is preſently impaired by them, and either he is at length undone, or at leaſt, finds himſelf in worſe circumſtances than if he had kept to the undoubted Rules of Honeſty. And ſuch an one being brought into Streights, his former ill dealings not only occaſion him fewer Friends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men to aſſiſt him in his neceſſity, but give him likewiſe juſt ground to expect far leſs of the Divine Favour and Compaſſion than he might otherwiſe have hoped for.

                        <hi>Judgment is turned away backwards, and juſtice ſtandeth afar off,</hi> when <hi>truth is fallen in the ſtreets, and equity cannot enter, and he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth from evil maketh himſelf a prey, then is the time for him to put on righteouſneſs as a breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:54666:158"/>and an helmet of ſalvation upon his Head, to put on the garments of vengeance for cloathing, and cover himſelf with zeal as with a cloak, and to repay fury to his adverſaries, and recompence to his Enemies, till they be brought to fear the name of the Lord from the weſt, and his glory from the riſing of the Sun.</hi> Or whatever other Grievance any labour under when it ſeems moſt incurable, it may in truth be ſooneſt cured.</p>
                     <p>Poſſibly ſome unobſerved natural way for an eſcape may in due time diſcover it ſelf; or if not, we know as certainly as God is, that he can order ſome other method of Relief for us. He ordinarily works by the uſe of Means (and this therefore is the courſe in which we are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to expect his Bleſſings) but he is not confined to theſe, but works as eaſily without them, when they fail, and in direct oppoſition to them, when they are not for his purpoſe; and will be ſure to do ſo as oft as he ſees it requiſite. He will not proſtitute his Miracles, and make them cheap, by vouchſafing them when there is no ſufficient reaſon for them; but he will make uſe of thoſe, rather than break his word; which he never has done, nor ever can do, though the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he has done frequently, to the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation and advantage of his faithfull Servants. And indeed God's Providence many times is neareſt and his help readieſt, when he ſees us the moſt deſtitute of Succour from any inferiour Means. <hi>Our Fathers and Mothers may forſake us,</hi> they from whom there is reaſon to hope for moſt kindneſs may caſt us off, and all other Creature Comforts may deceive us; but our good God will never do it, but <hi>will take us up</hi> in the midſt of all our Diſtractions.

Nor is it much greater to do it, when Afflictions befall us, but at the ſame time bring with them alſo a plain and eaſie direction for getting rid of them in a little while. But the difficulty is to confide ſtedfaſtly in God, when he frowns upon us, when his Hand lies heavy upon us, and he appears unwilling to remove it; to be able to ſay with <hi>Job,</hi> that admirable example of a ſure Truſt in God, as well as of an unwearied Patience,<note n="†" place="margin">Job 13.15.</note>

For a Man to repoſe himſelf, and all his concerns after this manner upon the Divine Providence is an Argument of a truly Chriſtian Temper, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences him to be acted by ſolid Principles, and that he is in good earneſt in what he profeſſes, and is fully perſwaded of the truth of God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and has a Mind deeply affected with them.

We muſt not allow our ſelves to be diſcouraged in our hardeſt Circumſtances, as though he would no longer have any regard for us, leaſt ſo we provoke him by our Diffidence to deal with us according to our Surmiſes; but ſhould rather earneſtly endeavour to raiſe up our Spirits, and animate and comfort our ſelves with an aſſurance of his gracious Protection, as of a ſufficient cure for all our Maladies.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore never let any imagine, that they have performed this excellent Duty as they ought, till they have brought themſelves to that ſteady dependance upon God, that howſoever he deals by them at preſent, or whatſoever portion he in his infinite Wiſdom judges fit to allot them, they do not fail however to reſt ſatisfy'd with theſe his Determinations, in a confident expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Relief againſt them, when it ſhall be propereſt for them. He is the beſt Judge of all Mens Neceſſities, and what Application he knows to be truly requiſite, he will certainly adminiſter, though not always in the ſame manner as they deſire.

                     <p>Bleſſed God! is this our Reſignation to thy moſt holy Will? is this all our Truſt in thee? alas, how far are we from duly <hi>caſting our Care upon thee,</hi> whilſt we thus ſenſeleſly ſuffer any croſs Accidents to eſtrange our Souls from thee? It is groſs folly to expect, or deſire all clear Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nothing but fair Sun-ſhine Days, without Foggs or Rain, or to repine at wholſome Winds to fan the Air and diſperſe its Vapours, or ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Showers to refreſh the Earth, and make it fruitfull. And no leſs unreaſonable is it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to our ſelves, to reckon upon nothing but Eaſe and Plenty, and abundance of Satisfaction in the enjoyment hereof, without recollecting what need we have of Afflictions to purifie and exalt our Minds, and put us upon preparing for a better ſtate, or to think our ſelves neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, whenever any remarkable portion of them falls to our ſhare. Whereas the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration hereof ſhould diſpoſe us on the contrary, to look up to God, as knowing that they all come from him, and to endeavour heartily to approve our ſelves to him, as firmly believing, that he will not fail to put an end to them, when
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:54666:161"/>he ſees us rightly prepared for it, and that it will be for our good; and in the mean time, till he does it, comforting our ſelves in the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance we have of ſuch his abundant Goodneſs to us. The fitteſt time for manifeſting our ſure Truſt in God is, when we labour under heavy Preſſures and Calamities, and have no hope of help from any elſe. And accordingly it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable duty in this caſe, ſtill to perſevere in an unwearied Dependance upon him, chearfully and comfortably waiting his Time for a Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Which being a Doctrine that concerned not the firſt Chriſtians only, but all that at any time fall under Perſecutions for the ſake of their Religion and their Saviour, as ſome have in all Ages, and many in our own times, in ſeveral parts of the World, and many more poſſibly may; that therefore which I deſign at preſent from theſe words, is, to apply the Doctrine ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to our ſelves, to try if we can be prevailed with to prepare our ſelves for the conſtant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it, as oft as we may have occaſion. And to this end I ſhall beg leave to enforce it from theſe ſeveral following Conſiderations.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. To be willing to ſuffer when called to it, is no more than our Religion enjoins us from time to time, as a neceſſary qualification for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Lord's Diſciples, and abſolutely requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in order to Salvation.</item>
                     <item>2. It is but what our bleſſed Lord has done for us in a very extraordinary manner.</item>
                     <pb n="234" facs="tcp:54666:165"/>
                     <item>3. This is the beſt and moſt effectual way of defending our Religion.</item>
                     <item>4. It is a Service that will undoubtedly meet with an abundant Recompence. And laſtly,</item>
                     <item>5. It is no ſuch dreadfull Task as Men are wont ordinarily to imagine. Of theſe in their order, and I begin with the firſt of them.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. To be willing to ſuffer whenever called to it is no more than our Religion enjoins us from time to time, as a neceſſary qualification for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Lord's Diſciples, and abſolutely requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in order to Salvation. It is not the portion of all actually to ſuffer for our Saviour's ſake; but there is no poſſibility of approving our ſelves good Chriſtians at preſent, or being happy here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, without a Readineſs and Preparation of Mind to do it, as oft as occaſion offers it ſelf; that is to ſay, whenſoever it cannot be avoided without Sin. There is no temporal Advantage ſo valuable, nor any Loſs or Cruelty ſo formidable, but that we muſt be content to conquer our ſelves in relation to it, even to part with<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>This is the firſt Conſideration; and is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, one would think, to engage all who have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Reverence for their crucified Redeemer, or any love for their own Souls, readily to ſubject themſelves to all kinds of Loſſes, Reproaches, or other the ſevereſt Afflictions, rather than both diſhonour their holy Profeſſion, and ruine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to all Eternity. However, that we may all be the rather invited to a chearfull ſuffering
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:54666:166"/>for the ſake of our Saviour, and the neceſſary Points and Principles of his Religion, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the next place, and now accordingly proceed to remind you, that</p>

                     <hi>in the form of God,</hi> and <hi>thought it not robbery to be equal with God,</hi> yet <hi>made</hi> he <hi>himſelf of no reputation,</hi> but <hi>took upon him the form of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſs of men: and being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf, and became obedient to death, even</hi> that vile, ſervile, ignominious, and cruel death, <hi>the death of the Croſs.</hi> He who had from all Eternity been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely happy together with the Father, out of his immenſe compaſſion to fallen Man, conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended in time to be born into the World, of a poor Virgin, to lead a mean and deſpicable, a troubleſome and uneaſie life, expoſed to all the Infirmities of Humane Nature, Sin only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and to die in the moſt contemptible and painfull manner, that hereby he might redeem us from Sin, Death, and Hell, and might reſtore us to his Father's Favour, and procure us a Title to the ineffable Glories of his everlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>What intolerable Diſingenuity therefore, what monſtrous Ingratitude muſt it be, for any of thoſe whom he has thus exceſſively commiſerated to ſtick at any the ſevereſt Sufferings, much more to be unwilling to part with only ſome preſent poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, or other outward conveniencies in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Command?

                  <p>It therefore now remains, that we be entreated to behave our ſelves accordingly, that we be not affrighted from our profeſſion by whatſoever Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, but adhere firmly to our Religion and all the Principles and Branches of it, as well in times of Danger, as when we may do it more ſecurely;<note n="*" place="margin">Vir bonus— ſtatuit omnem cruciatum per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, intolerabili dolore lacerari, potius quàm aut officium prodat aut fidem. <hi>Cicer.

'Tis true, this is no very agreeable Doctrine to the corrupt Inclinations of Mankind, as not ſuiting well with Fleſh and Blood; and hence it comes to paſs, that Men had rather hear of, than practiſe it.
